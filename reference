Thank you for bringing that to my attention. It seems the database system you're using doesn't support some of the more advanced SQL features. Let's modify the query to use a more universally compatible approach:

SELECT t.IDTable, t.TenBan, t.Tang, o.IDOrder, o.TGBatDau, o.TGKetThuc
FROM Tables t
LEFT JOIN [Order] o ON t.IDTable = o.IDTable
WHERE o.IDOrder IS NULL OR o.IDOrder = (
    SELECT TOP 1 IDOrder
    FROM [Order] o2
    WHERE o2.IDTable = t.IDTable
    ORDER BY ABS(DATEDIFF('n', o2.TGBatDau, Now()))
)

Copy

Apply

This query uses a correlated subquery to find the order with the start time nearest to the current time for each table. It's more compatible with various database systems, including MS Access. The query will return one record per table, either with no order information (if the table has no orders) or with the order closest to the current time.

Can you add iif condition so that it will return the table is available or not.

Certainly! I'd be happy to add an IIF condition to determine if a table is available or not. Here's the updated query with the availability status:

SELECT t.IDTable, t.TenBan, t.Tang, o.IDOrder, o.TGBatDau, o.TGKetThuc,
    IIF(o.IDOrder IS NULL OR Now() < o.TGBatDau OR Now() > o.TGKetThuc, 'Available', 'Not Available') AS Status
FROM Tables t
LEFT JOIN [Order] o ON t.IDTable = o.IDTable
WHERE o.IDOrder IS NULL OR o.IDOrder = (
    SELECT TOP 1 IDOrder
    FROM [Order] o2
    WHERE o2.IDTable = t.IDTable
    ORDER BY ABS(DATEDIFF('n', o2.TGBatDau, Now()))
)

Copy

Apply

This query adds a new column called 'Status' using the IIF function. It checks if:

There's no order for the table (o.IDOrder IS NULL), or
The current time is before the start time of the order (Now() < o.TGBatDau), or
The current time is after the end time of the order (Now() > o.TGKetThuc)
If any of these conditions are true, the status is set to 'Available'. Otherwise, it's set to 'Not Available'.

This enhancement provides a clear view of each table's availability status based on the current time and the nearest order. It's a great addition to help users quickly identify which tables can be booked right now.
