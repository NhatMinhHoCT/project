Here's how to systematically test your Laravel website with each tool:

nmap - Initial Reconnaissance
nmap -sV -p- your-website.com

Copy

Execute

nmap -A -T4 your-website.com

Copy

Execute

xxser - Testing XSS vulnerabilities First, capture the login request with your credentials:
xsser --url "http://your-website.com/login" --data "email=test@email.com&password=yourpass" --cookie "PHPSESSID=yoursessionid"

Copy

Execute

Test post-authentication pages:

xsser --url "http://your-website.com/dashboard" --cookie "PHPSESSID=yoursessionid" --crawling

Copy

Execute

nosqlmap - While your site uses MySQL, testing NoSQL injections is still valuable:
python nosqlmap.py -u "http://your-website.com/login" -d "email=test@email.com&password=yourpass" --cookie "PHPSESSID=yoursessionid"

Copy

Execute

Additional Laravel-specific testing tips:

Test CSRF protection bypass
Check file upload vulnerabilities
Test input validation on all forms
Verify session handling
Check for SQL injection in Eloquent queries
Test API endpoints if available
Remember to:

Keep session cookies updated in your tests
Document all findings
Test in both authenticated and unauthenticated states
Focus on critical functionality first
Test both GET and POST requests
These tests will help identify potential security issues in your Laravel application while maintaining the integrity of your development environment.

Use different user-agents to simulate various clients
Combine commands for comprehensive testing
These commands provide a solid foundation for security testing your Laravel application, covering various attack vectors and vulnerabilities.

how to get cookies and csrf token




Context
— none fetched
Here are effective ways to get cookies and CSRF tokens:

Using Browser Developer Tools:

Open Developer Tools (F12)
Go to Network tab
Make a request to your site
Look for:
Cookies in Response Headers
CSRF token in HTML meta tags or form fields
Laravel session cookie
Using cURL:

curl -v -c cookies.txt http://your-website.com

Copy

Execute

curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt http://your-website.com | grep csrf

Copy

Execute

Using Python requests:

import requests

session = requests.Session()
response = session.get('http://your-website.com')

# Get cookies
cookies = session.cookies.get_dict()
print("Cookies:", cookies)

# Get CSRF from meta tag
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
csrf_token = soup.find('meta', {'name': 'csrf-token'})['content']
print("CSRF Token:", csrf_token)

Copy

Apply

get_tokens.py
Using Burp Suite:

Configure browser to use Burp Proxy
Navigate to target website
Check Proxy > HTTP history
Look for cookies and CSRF tokens in requests/responses
Using Chrome Extension:

Install "Cookie Editor" extension
Click the extension icon
View all cookies for current domain
These methods help you capture the necessary tokens for security testing. The captured tokens can then be used with xxser, nosqlmap, or other testing tools.

Remember to regularly refresh tokens as they expire, especially in Laravel where CSRF tokens are rotated for security.

Here's how to effectively read and interpret nmap vulners scan results:

Running the vulners scan:

nmap -sV --script vulners your-website.com

Copy

Execute

Reading the Results:

CVE References
Look for CVE-XXXX-XXXX patterns
Higher CVSS scores (7.0-10.0) need immediate attention
Multiple CVEs for one service indicate high risk
Service Information
Check version numbers of detected services
Match versions against known vulnerabilities
Note outdated software versions
Vulnerability Categories
RCE (Remote Code Execution)
DoS (Denial of Service)
Information Disclosure
Privilege Escalation
Risk Levels
Critical (9.0-10.0)
High (7.0-8.9)
Medium (4.0-6.9)
Low (0.1-3.9)
Example Output Interpretation:

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.0
| vulners:
|   cpe:/a:nginx:nginx:1.14.0:
|     CVE-2019-9513  7.8  # High risk - DoS vulnerability
|     CVE-2019-9511  7.8  # High risk - Need immediate patch
|     CVE-2018-16845 6.5  # Medium risk - Review needed

Copy

Execute

Key Actions:

Prioritize high CVSS score vulnerabilities
Document all findings
Cross-reference with security advisories
Create remediation plan
Schedule updates for vulnerable services
This structured approach helps identify and address security issues effectively.

i mean the result contains like *exploit, what does it mean

Let me explain the nmap vulners script output indicators:

(asterisk) ratings in vulners results:
***** (5 stars) = Confirmed working exploit exists
**** (4 stars) = Exploit code is available
*** (3 stars) = Proof of concept exists
** (2 stars) = No exploit but detailed information available
(1 star) = Basic vulnerability information
Example output interpretation:

80/tcp open  http    Apache 2.4.29
| vulners:
|   cpe:/a:apache:http_server:2.4.29:
|     CVE-2019-0211***** 7.2    # 5 stars = Working exploit available
|     CVE-2019-0220***   6.8    # 3 stars = PoC exists
|     CVE-2019-0196*     6.4    # 1 star = Basic info only

Copy

Execute

The more asterisks, the more dangerous the vulnerability because:

More stars mean more exploit information is available
Attackers can more easily exploit these vulnerabilities
They require immediate attention
They pose greater risk to your system
This rating system helps you:

Prioritize vulnerability patching
Assess real-world risk levels
Focus on most critical issues first
Make informed security decisions
